# Zero to Hero ML Workshop

This Jupyter notebook is a comprehensive guide designed for participants to transition from beginners to proficient users in the field of Machine Learning (ML). It covers essential concepts and techniques in data science and machine learning, using Python as the programming language.

## Objectives

- **Understand Basic Data Handling**: Learn how to load, clean, and preprocess data using Python's powerful libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into your data by visualizing and analyzing its characteristics, using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Dive into the basics of machine learning, focusing on creating and evaluating models. This workshop covers linear regression, lasso, and ridge regression models.
- **Practical Skills**: Apply the concepts learned to real-world datasets, enhancing your ability to preprocess data, build models, and interpret the results.
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Improve your workflow in data science projects by learning efficient data handling and analysis techniques.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy for numerical computing.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning, including model creation, data splitting, and preprocessing.

## Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of Python programming. Familiarity with fundamental mathematical concepts is helpful but not required.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries mentioned above.
3. Download the workshop Jupyter notebook and follow along with the exercises.

This workshop is designed to be interactive, with examples and exercises that guide you through the process of understanding and applying ML concepts and techniques.

## Conclusion

By the end of this workshop, participants will have a solid foundation in handling data, performing exploratory data analysis, and building and evaluating simple machine learning models. This knowledge will serve as a stepping stone for further exploration into more advanced machine learning techniques and concepts.
